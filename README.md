## Introduction
The project is a simple Express application structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern,
with a clear separation of concerns. In addition to standard MVC components, implemented a separated
data access layer to interact with the database, ensuring encapsulation and abstraction of database operations.

This project can serve as a valuable blueprint for starting your own Express projects,
providing a solid foundation for structuring and organizing code.
Key features of our project include an authorization service for managing user access, an Express
validator for validating incoming requests, and a separated data access layer for database
interaction, promoting code maintainability and scalability.
